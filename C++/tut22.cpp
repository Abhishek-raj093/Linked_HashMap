    //      - No methods
    // Classes ---> Strecture + more
    // Classes ---> Can have method and properties
    // Classes ---> Can make few members as private & few as public
    // Structures in C++ are typedefed
    // you can declare objects along with the class declarion like this:
        /* Class Employee{
            class defination
        } harry, rohan, lovish;*/
